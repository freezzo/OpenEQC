In light of your presence among us. we have gathered our knowledge and memories of lives past upon Norrath in hopes that our experiences would benefit you in the present. Do not hesitate to approach all citizens of this district. for we are equally fair and willing to grant you the aid that is within our individual power to provide. In my own personal experience upon Norrath. I was a wizard of some power -- though I do not boast. I have offered my knowledge of this art to any who would have the desire to learn from me. Unfortunately. time is not a luxury that you posses in the manner that we of the Plane are graced and thus. I may only offer instruction on skills. If you are in need of spells. then the library of Myrist should be your destination. The scholars there are infinitely wise despite their mortal lineage.'"); }
