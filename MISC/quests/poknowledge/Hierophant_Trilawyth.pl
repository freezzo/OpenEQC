The adepts of the city have come together collectively and as individuals in hopes of aiding our visitors as we are able. In my time upon Norrath. I served as a child of nature dedicated to Tunare. the Mother of All. Though my faith has not wavered and my philosophies of nature have only grown in this astral city. I am able to train any druid who is in need of gaining a better grasp upon their skills. Mind you. however. that I am not a preacher and will not guide you through the instruction of faith or spell. for it is these things you must acquire and perfect through your own trials.'"); }
