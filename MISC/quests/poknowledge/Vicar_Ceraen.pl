quest::say("Greetings. $name. I am Ceraen. priest of Tunare and resident of New Tanaan for over three centuries of my existence.  Do not fear those whom may have been your enemy upon the prime. The scholars are equal and without bias toward one another. thus there is no safer place in the cosmos than New Tanaan. Each resident strives to bring knowledge closer to the curious and willing. and I am not exempt from this. If you are a priest in your world and seek to gain a higher understanding of the divine power that your faith has allowed you to wield. then perhaps what spells I have penned from memory of your world would be of use. I have also mastered levels in the workings of planar magic and its chaotic ways of forming upon the manifested planes. If by chance you come across a fledgling arcane item -- you will know it for its incorporeal state -- then do not hesitate to bring it to me. I may be able to infuse it with the powers of the divine and forge from it a spell of priestly might."); }
