quest::say("A dark day to you. $name. New Tanaan has opened its arms to all of Norrath's travelers and scholars alike -- though still I doubt most are worthy of our infinite and unsurpassed knowledge. In any case. we all must uphold the laws of our city. else we become as debased and pathetic as the secular. warring cultures of the material universe. You will find that. despite the medium of our birth or the shadow of faith in our hearts. we are all equally tolerant of each being to approach us. Though I myself am no stranger to the duties of a mentor. I do not think that at this juncture. I would provide any useful assistance to any not of the many clergies associated with the pantheon. If you do indeed serve one of the gods of Nature and Influence. then my services may not prove a waste of our collective time. Search my inventory at your will. and purchase what you wish should you find anything of use to you at this point in your life of service."); }
