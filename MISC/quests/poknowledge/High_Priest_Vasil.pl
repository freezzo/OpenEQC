High Priest of Brell Serillis and resident master of the clerical arts in the district of Tanaan. If you have come in search of a mentor to guide you through the skills of your priesthood. then do not be discouraged by my own declaration of faith should it differ from yours. I cannot teach you how to know and be close to your deity in life. for only you may know that individually. but I can impart to you the fundamental basics that every priest. despite the object of their undying faith and devotion. wields in their life of service.'"); }
