quest::say("Good day. traveler. Many curious people about these recent days. all inquiring in their thirst for knowledge and personal advancement. Well. if you lead the humble life of a fisherman. or break from the squalls of battle for some peace and quiet at a river or sea shore. then you have come to the right man. All the supplies any fisherman needs may be purchased at my shop. though if for some reason I do not possess that which you are seeking. perhaps my comrade. Daeld. will.  Or have you come perhaps to help me with my studies?"); }
